Currently, I'm undergoing my BSc degree in Computer Science at [Unipampa](https://www.unipampa.edu.br). I'm a member of the [Laboratório de Otimização de Sistemas](https://www.instagram.com/los_unipampa/?locale=us&hl=am-et), working mostly in projects that aims to develop scalable solutions for integrating machine learning into programmable network devices. I'm also working with the company CDNTV through a research and development grant, contributing to the development of scalable solutions for video streaming and live broadcasting.

In my free time, I enjoy working on independent projects, focusing mostly on web applications, machine learning models in Python, and exploring low-level programming with C. I also like to play video games, watch movies and series, and read books.
